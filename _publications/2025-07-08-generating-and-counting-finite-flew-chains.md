Many-valued logics are based on truth algebras that extend beyond the classical Boolean algebra. Such algebraic structures have given rise to several logical systems with a wide range of potential applications. FLew-algebras are relatively well studied, and previous studies have focused on counting the different instances that may exist of a given size. In this paper, we answer the same question for FLew-chains with a novel approach, effectively providing both an accessible and open-source algorithmic tool for generating and counting FLew-chains and an explicit numerical bound.
