I am an Italian PhD fellow in Mathematics at the University of Ferrara, mostly interested in
Many-Valued Logics, Automated Theorem Proving and Symbolic Machine Learning. I am also part 
of the 
[Applied Computational Logic and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://aclai.unife.it/en/) 
at the University of Ferrara. At the moment, I am also a visiting PhD student at the University
of Queensland.

The main goal of my research is to improve Symbolic Machine Learning algorithms through the
use (and relative study) of non-classical logic, with a double aim:
* managing to better treat uncertainties and intricate relations in the data
* enhancing Interpretable AI systems performance so that one does not have to give up model
  interpretation to get accurate outputs

In the last year I manly focused on the study of Many-Valued Logics and their algebraic
counterpart, contributing to the development of analytic tableaux systems for these logics
up to the Many-Valued Modal case, specifically for a Many-Valued version of the Halpern and 
Shoham Interval Temporal Logic.

I am also a Computer Scientist, so (almost) all of my work is (or will be) also implemented.
In the last year, I became very fond of the Julia programming language, and I have been
contributing to the development of the [Sole.jl](https://github.com/aclai-lab/Sole.jl)
ecosystem, a framework for symbolic, transparent, and interpretable machine learning.
Specifically, I have been contributing on the Many-Valued Logic support of
[SoleLogics.jl](https://github.com/aclai-lab/SoleLogics.jl), a Julia package for
computational logic provifing easy manipulation of propositional and (multi)modal logics,
logical formulas and interpretations, as well as algorithms for finite model checking, and
on the development of [SoleReasoners.jl](https://github.com/aclai-lab/SoleReasoners.jl), a 
Julia package providing a sat solver and an automatic theorem prover based on analytic 
tableau techniques for Propositional, Modal, Many-Valued, and Modal Many-Valued Logics.

If any of these topics tickles your mind, don't be afraid of reaching me!
