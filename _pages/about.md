I am an Italian PhD fellow in Mathematics at the University of Ferrara, Italy,
interested in Many-Valued Multi-Modal Logics and their application to Symbolic
Machine Learning. I am also part of the 
[Applied Computational Logic and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://aclai.unife.it/en/) 
at the University of Ferrara. I was also visiting student at the University of
Queensland, Australia, for two consecutive years (2024, 2025).

The main goal of my research is to improve Symbolic Machine Learning algorithms
through the use (and relative study) of non-classical logic, with a double aim:
* managing to better treat uncertainties and intricate relations in the data
* enhancing Interpretable AI systems performance so that one does not have to
give up model interpretation to get accurate outputs

In the last two years I manly focused on the study of Many-Valued Multi-Modal
Logics and their algebraic counterpart, contributing to the development of a
reasoning tool based on the analytic tableaux technique to check for
satisfiability and vadility of formulae in these logics (actually, a many-valued
relaxation of these problems).

I am also a Computer Scientist, so (almost) all of my work is (or will be)
implemented as well. In the last years, I became very fond of the Julia
programming language, and I have been contributing to the development of the
[Sole.jl](https://github.com/aclai-lab/Sole.jl) ecosystem, a framework for
symbolic, transparent, and interpretable machine learning. Specifically, my main
contributions have been on the Many-Valued Logic support of
[SoleLogics.jl](https://github.com/aclai-lab/SoleLogics.jl), a Julia package for
computational logic providing easy manipulation of propositional and
(multi-)modal logics, logical formulas and interpretations, as well as
algorithms for finite model checking, and on the development of
[SoleReasoners.jl](https://github.com/aclai-lab/SoleReasoners.jl), a Julia
package providing a sat solver and an automatic theorem prover based on analytic 
tableau technique for Propositional, (Multi-)Modal, Many-Valued, and Many-Valued
(Multi-)Modal Logics.
