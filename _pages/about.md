I am an Italian PhD fellow in Mathematics at the University of Ferrara, Italy,
interested in Many-Valued Multi-Modal Logics and their application to Symbolic
Machine Learning and to Automated Reasoning. I am also part of the 
[
  Applied Computational Logic and Artificial Intelligence Lab
](
  https://aclai.unife.it/en/
) 
at the University of Ferrara. I was also visiting student at the University of
Queensland, Australia, for two consecutive years (2024, 2025).

My main supervisor is Prof.
[Guido Sciavicco](https://sites.google.com/unife.it/guido)
(University of Ferrara) and my co-advisors are Prof.
[Guillermo Badia](https://sites.google.com/site/guillermobadialogic/home)
(University of Queensland) and Prof.
[Carles Noguera](https://sites.google.com/view/carlesnoguera/)
(University of Siena).

The main goal of my research is to improve Symbolic Machine Learning algorithms
through the use (and relative study) of non-classical logic, with a double aim:
* managing to better treat uncertainties and intricate relations in the data
* enhancing Interpretable AI systems performance so that one does not have to
give up model interpretation to get accurate outputs

In the last two years I manly focused on the study of Many-Valued Multi-Modal
Logics and their algebraic counterpart, contributing to the development of a
reasoning tool based on the analytic tableaux technique to check for
satisfiability and vadility of formulae in these logics (actually, a many-valued
relaxation of these problems).

I am also a Computer Scientist, so (almost) all of my work is (or will be)
implemented as well. In the last years, I became very fond of the Julia
programming language, and I have been contributing to the development of the
[Sole.jl](https://github.com/aclai-lab/Sole.jl) ecosystem, a framework for
symbolic, transparent, and interpretable machine learning. Specifically, my main
contributions have been on the Many-Valued Logic support of
[SoleLogics.jl](https://github.com/aclai-lab/SoleLogics.jl), a Julia package for
computational logic providing easy manipulation of propositional and
(multi-)modal logics, logical formulas and interpretations, as well as
algorithms for finite model checking, and on the development of
[SoleReasoners.jl](https://github.com/aclai-lab/SoleReasoners.jl), a Julia
package providing a sat solver and an automatic theorem prover based on analytic 
tableau technique for Propositional, (Multi-)Modal, Many-Valued, and Many-Valued
(Multi-)Modal Logics.
